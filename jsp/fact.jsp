<p><font color="#3300CC" size="+1">What is coronary heart disease?</font></p>
<p> Coronary Heart Disease is a condition which affects the vessels which supply
      the heart's muscle with blood, oxygen and nutrients. If these blood vessels
        (coronary arteries) become partially blocked, a person can have decreased
        heart function
      and may experience pain in the chest, arm, neck or jaw (angina). If the
  vessels become completely blocked, some of the heart muscle can die, which
  is called
  a heart attack (myocardial infarction). </p>
<p>Blood vessels can become narrowed from fat and cholesterol build-up inside
  the artery walls, which is a disease known as atherosclerosis. The disease
  process can start when conditions, like high blood pressure (hypertension),
  diabetes, high cholesterol and smoking, cause damage to artery walls. The body
  tries to repair the damage, but in the process, fat, cholesterol, calcium and
  other substances can be deposited in artery walls. Over time this build-up
  (plaque) can narrow the artery walls and can also develop a hard fibrous cap.
  If this fibrous cap ruptures, a blood clot can form and completely block the
  blood vessel, leading to a heart attack.</p>
<p>In some cases, a vessel can also be blocked by a spasm in the artery. Spasms
  can occur and lead to heart attacks in vessels with or without atherosclerosis.<br>
  <br>
  <font color="#3300CC" size="+1">How common is coronary heart disease?</font></p>
<p> Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) is the leading cause of death in the United
        States and kills over 400,000 men and women each year. One out of every
        five deaths is due to CHD. One-third of people who have a heart attack
        do not
        survive it. In addition, over 12 million Americans are currently living
    with coronary heart disease pain and/or heart problems.</p>
<p><font color="#3300CC" size="+1">Who is at risk?</font></p>
<p>Both men and women are at risk of developing CHD, however it is not usually
        seen in men younger than 40 or in women of reproductive age. There are
        many different factors that affect the risk of CHD. Some of these risk
        factors
        cannot be altered, like family history, advanced age and sex, but there
        are many others that can be changed or controlled, like smoking, exercise,
        body
        weight, cholesterol, blood pressure, and blood sugar. There are many
  lifestyle factors and medications that can help reduce the risk of atherosclerosis,
coronary heart disease and heart attack.</p>
<p>    <br>
  <font color="#3300CC" size="+1">How can you prevent it?</font></p>
<p><br>
    There are many things that you can do to reduce your risk of heart disease,
      like: <br>
    not smoking <br>
    avoiding second-hand smoke (also called environmental tobacco smoke) <br>
    eating well <br>
    maintaining a healthy weight <br>
    exercising regularly <br>
    avoiding high blood pressure <br>
    treating diabetes but still have elevated risk <br>
    controlling your cholesterol levels <br>
    If you already have heart disease or risk factors for it, it is important
      to see your doctor regularly to address lifestyle issues and medications
  that can help treat your condition.</p>
<p><font color="#3300CC" size="+1">Who should be screened?</font></p>
<p><br>
    For people without symptoms, there is no good screening test for CHD. If
      you have symptoms or risk factors, your doctor may want to do an electrocardiogram
      (EKG) to look at the electrical activity of your heart, or some other test
  to examine your heart function.</p>
<p>People of all ages should be screened periodically for risk factors of CHD:
  diabetes, high blood pressure, abnormal cholesterol levels and overweight/obesity.</p>
<p><font color="#3300CC" size="+1"><br>
What are the symptoms?</font></p>
<p>  The most common symptom of CHD is chest pain, but coronary heart disease
    can also be &quot;silent&quot; causing a heart attack or sudden death without
    any warning signs. The &quot;classic&quot; symptom of a heart attack is pain
    or pressure in the chest that can spread to the arm, shoulder, neck or jaw.
    This pain/pressure may also come with shortness of breath, sweating, nausea
    or lightheadedness. Some people experience abdominal pain, nausea, shortness
    of breath, palpitations or weakness without any chest pain. If you have any
of these symptoms, see a doctor immediately.</p>
