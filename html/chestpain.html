Angina pectoris is a manifestation of coronary heart disease, yet little is known from clinical or epidemiologic studies about its prognosis in older populations. Exertional chest pain was a strong, independent predictor of coronary heart disease death for older men and women. There were no differences in the prognostic implications of this symptom between the sexes; the relative risks being 2.4 (95% confidence interval, 1.4-4.4) in men and 2.7 (1.7-4.2) in women. The risk of coronary heart disease mortality for those reporting chest pain on exertion was at least as high as that for participants whose symptoms met the Rose Questionnaire criteria for angina.
