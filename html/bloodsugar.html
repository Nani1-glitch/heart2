<p align="justify"><font color="#0000FF">Glucose intolerance is a risk factor for coronary disease, but there is uncertainty about the shape of the dose-response relationship between glucose level and risk of coronary mortality. We examined the prospective relation of 2-h postload blood glucose (2hBG) with coronary and other major causes of mortality over 33 years. <br><br>
<b>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS:</b>A 50-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was performed at baseline (1967-1969) in 17,869 male civil servants aged 40-64 years. <br><br>
