Increasing age ? Over 83 percent of people who die of coronary heart disease are 65 or older. At older ages, women who have heart attacks are more likely than men are to die from them within a few weeks.

An individual's risk of a heart attack gradually increases as he or she gets older. Also, the older a person is, the more likely the heart attack will be fatal. According to the American Heart Association, four out of five people who die of a heart attack are over the age of 65.
